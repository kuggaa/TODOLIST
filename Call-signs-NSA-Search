The 2000 reorganization

In the year 2000, then director Michael Hayden reorganized much of NSA's organizational structure. For this the NSA Transformation Office (NTO) was established and the directorates of Operations and of Technology were merged into the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID).

Also new officers were appointed, like a Chief Financial manager, a Chief Information Officer (CIO), a Senior Acquisition Executive (SAE) and a Transformation Officer. Around the same time, many NSA divisions and units got new designations.

Also in 2000, a Senior Leadership team was formed, consisting of the Director (DIRNSA), the Deputy Director and the Directors of the Signals Intelligence (SID), the Information Assurance (IAD) and the Technology Directorate (TD). The chiefs of other main NSA divisions became Associate Directors of the Senior Leadership team.

    
The 2016 reorganization

In 2016, NSA director Michael Rogers initiated a reorganization under the name NSA21, which has to prepare the agency for "cyber" challenges. One of the most important changes will be to replace the Signals Intelligence (SID) and Information Assurance (IAD) directorates by a new Directorate of Operations that combines the operational elements of each.

Also the other existing branches will be reorganized into the following 6 new directorates:
- Workforce and Support Activities
- Business Management and Acquisition
- Engagement and Policy
- Operations
- Capabilities
- Research
